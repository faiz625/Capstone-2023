# Project Name: Eye Gaze Tracker

## Overview
This project implements an eye gaze tracking system that uses webcam data to control the cursor on a computer screen. It features adaptive calibration for various screen sizes, resolutions, and user distances, ensuring accurate cursor movements based on eye gaze.

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:faiz625/Capstone-2023.git
2. Install require dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Usage

1. Run the calibration.py file, to calibrate your screen/gaze to the program requirements
   ```bash
   python trackgaze.py
2. After calibration, run the demo.py file, and it will start the actual eye tracking to mouse movement file:
   ```bash
   python trackgaze.py
